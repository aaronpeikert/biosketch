As a researcher sometimes you have to submit an embarrassing biosketch about yourself (in third person, really?). Here is mine, in first person:

Aaron Peikert acquired my master in psychology at the Humboldt-Universtit√§t zu Berlin (HU).
Half of what he learned there is wrong (known as replication crisis), and ever since he is trying to find out which half.
In this quest, he first focused on statistical methods and psychometrics at the Department of Diagnostics at HU.
He got to broaden this view and focus on open science practices in general, when he joined the formal methods group of lifespan psychology at the Max Plank Institut for Human Development (MPIB) as a Phd Student.
At MPIB his core research interests are computational reproducibility and the philosophy of preregistration.
On the side, he is codeveloping [StructuralEquationModels.jl](https://github.com/StructuralEquationModels/StructuralEquationModels.jl) and researching the abilities of regularized structural equation modells for theorey development and how to develop random effects machine learning algorythms.
